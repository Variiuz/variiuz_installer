# Variiuz Server Installer Script
Small script i wrote for fun and because I was to lazy to just install a Minecraft Server myself.

It has an auto-updater so you should be fine either downloading this or do
```bash
 wget https://cdn.alex-needs.space/share/variiuz_installer.sh
```
if it asks you to update the script, answer with `y` to get the latest version.

Make sure to give it permissions with

```bash
 chmod +x variiuz_installer.sh
```

I tested it with ubuntu xenial and bionic, it should support newer debian version too.

I won't update the script on GitHub everytime so make sure you download the newest version through the script itself,
I should say this is my first script I made. As I said it was made ofrom boredom and lazyness.
