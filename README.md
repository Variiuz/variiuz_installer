# Variiuz Server Installer Script
Small script i wrote for fun and because I was to lazy to just install a Minecraft Server myself.

It has an auto-updater so you should be fine either downloading this or do
```bash
 wget https://cdn.alex-is-a.ninja/share/variiuz_installer.sh
```
it asks you to update the script, answer with `y` to get the latest version.

I tested it with ubuntu xenial and bionic, it should support newer debian version too.
